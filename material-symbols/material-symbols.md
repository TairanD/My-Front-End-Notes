# Using Material Symbols in Web

## 1 - What's Material Symbols
Material Symbols are Google's **icons**, consolidating over 2,500 glyphs in a single font file with a wide range of design 
**variants**. Symbols are available in three styles and four adjustable variable font axes (fill, weight, grade, and optical size).

## 2 - How to Use them?
1. Developers can access icon resources through [Google website](https://fonts.google.com/icons) by including
the following code into the html file. 

    ```<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined" rel="stylesheet" />```

    The above snippet includes the default configuration for each axis, 
with weight at 400, optical size at 48, grade at 0 and fill (also 0.)

2. Use the Fonts CSS API to configure different axes values.
