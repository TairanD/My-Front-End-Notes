# How Browsers Display UIs

## 1 - Load HTML (like from internet)
## 2 - Transform HTML into a Document Object Model (DOM)
### 2-1 DOM
DOM is what our document represented in the computer memory. It has a tree structure containing nodes. Each element, 
attribute, and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. Nodes are defined by 
their relationship (e.g. parent nodes & child nodes) to other DOM nodes. DOM is where CSS and documents meet up.
