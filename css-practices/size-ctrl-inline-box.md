# Inline-Block Alignment with Size Control
When we want elements to be horizontally aligned on the same line but also want to set their width and height.

-> 

Adding property `display: inline-block;`. It will give the element characteristics from both block & inline:
- Width and height can be set: In contrast to inline elements, inline-block elements can have width and height set, and these settings will take effect.
- Horizontal arrangement (inline feature): However, unlike block-level elements, it doesn't force a line break, and inline-block elements appear horizontally on the same line, similar to inline elements.
